**Be a Chad. Don't act like a Virgin.**

Being a Chad isn't about machismo. Chad is The Way, not the Destination. Chads improve themselves physically, mentally, and emotionally, and help others do the same. We aren't perfect today, but we're all gonna make it.

The squabbles of politics and culture wars are below us. Chads focus on common interests to build a community, whereas Virgins complain that they live in a society.

Lift your body. Lift your mind. Lift your soul.

Lift the world.
